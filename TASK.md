- **Testing Coverage**: 11 unit test cases covering form validation, submission, accessibility
- **E2E Testing**: 11 comprehensive scenarios including API persistence, unique ID generation, state handling
- **Missing Pattern**: Initially lacked Storybook stories - added retrospectively for full compliance

### Dynamic House Listing (2025-08-25)
- **Critical Problem Solved**: Eliminated disconnect between house creation and listing visibility
- **API Enhancement**: Added GET /api/houses endpoint to existing route.ts (300ms delay for UX)
- **Client Component Conversion**: Transformed static server component to dynamic client component with "use client"
- **Modern Loading States**: Implemented skeleton placeholders (2025 best practice) instead of spinners
- **Comprehensive State Management**: Loading, error (with retry), empty (with CTA), and success states
- **Dynamic Table Rendering**: Real-time house list that grows as properties are added
- **Data Integration**: Uses existing getHousesFromStorage() utility and House TypeScript types
- **User Experience**: Click-to-detail navigation, status badges, formatted addresses, creation dates
- **Error Handling**: Network error recovery with user-friendly retry mechanism
- **Responsive Design**: Maintains mobile/desktop compatibility with existing styling patterns

### Workflow Compliance (2025-08-25)
- **Pattern Adherence**: All features follow documented co-location pattern (Component + Tests + Stories)
- **Architecture Compliance**: Uses Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript strict mode, Tailwind CSS v4
- **Testing Strategy**: Implements unit tests (Vitest), integration tests (RTL), E2E tests (Playwright)
- **Documentation**: Features align with PLANNING.md conventions and PROJECT-README.md workflow
- **Modern Standards**: 2025 React data fetching patterns, skeleton loading, proper error boundaries

- **Storage Architecture**: Mirrored house storage patterns with localStorage + server memory, base64 photo conversion
- **API Integration**: RESTful endpoints at /api/houses/[id]/residents with FormData photo upload support
- **Modal Form Component**: ResidentForm.tsx with React Hook Form, file upload, sectioned layout, proper error states
- **Dynamic Table Display**: ResidentTable.tsx with photo thumbnails, calculated age, loading/error/empty states
- **House Integration**: Seamlessly integrated into house detail page with optimistic updates and refresh triggers

### Dual Resident Creation Pattern (2025-08-26)
- **Enhanced Architecture**: Extended ResidentForm.tsx to support both "house-context" and "standalone" modes via props

- **Global Table Component**: Implemented GlobalResidentTable.tsx showing residents across all houses with house name display
- **Conditional Form Logic**: Smart form that shows house selection only in standalone mode, validates house requirement
- **Dual API Strategy**: House-context uses /api/houses/[id]/residents, standalone uses /api/residents with houseId in FormData
- **Testing Coverage**: Added comprehensive unit tests for both modes and E2E tests for standalone resident creation flow
- **Seamless Integration**: Residents created via global page appear correctly in house detail views and vice versa
- **Consistent UX**: Both creation methods follow identical form patterns, validation, loading states, and error handling
- **Storage Consistency**: Single getAllResidents() utility ensures data consistency across both views
