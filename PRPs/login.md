name: "Feature PRP Example - A warm login screen

## Purpose
The haven login page is functionally your "normal" login page, structured just like a login.salesforce page.
The difference though is the brand and the warmth. The Haven login image (in assets) makes this a pleassurable experience as that image i swarm and easy on the eyes.

## Core Principles
1. **warm**: make this beautiful
** Secure ** only user with the correct login details can login
**There is no sign up option, you need to be invites ( seperate feature)
** When a login attempt fails, a useful error is thrown)
