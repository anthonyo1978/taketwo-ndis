# PRD: Transactions System for NDIS Provider Management

## Overview

The Transactions system provides a comprehensive billing and contract drawdown management solution for NDIS accommodation providers. It serves as the central source of truth for all billable events, automatically reducing contract balances and providing operational visibility for reconciliation and payment claims.

## Problem Statement

NDIS providers need to:
- Track billable events against resident contracts with precision
- Automatically drawdown contract balances as services are provided
- Maintain audit trails for government compliance and claim processing
- Provide operational dashboards showing house → resident → contract → transaction visibility
- Enable bulk processing of transactions for efficiency
- Export data for external claim systems

## Solution

A dense, high-performance transactions table with inline balance calculations, comprehensive filtering, bulk operations, and deep integration with the existing resident/contract system.

## Key Features

### 1. Transaction Management Table
- **Route**: `/admin/transactions`
- **Design Pattern**: Based on shadcnexamples.com/tasks for high-density UX
- **Technology**: TanStack Table + shadcn/ui components
- **Pagination**: 25 records per page (configurable)

### 2. Comprehensive Filtering & Search
- **Header Controls**: Date range, client, contract, house, status filters
- **Quick Search**: Service codes and transaction notes
- **Column Filters**: Individual column quick filters
- **Sorting**: Date (desc default), amount, client, status

### 3. Transaction States & Lifecycle
- **Draft**: Created but not posted to contract balance
- **Posted**: Applied to contract balance, deducting available funds
- **Voided**: Reversed transaction, restores balance
- **Validation**: Prevents negative balances, shows remaining after post

### 4. Bulk Operations
- **Bulk Post**: Convert multiple draft transactions to posted
- **Bulk Void**: Reverse multiple posted transactions (with constraints)
- **CSV Export**: Export selected or filtered transactions
- **Bulk Select**: Checkbox-based row selection

### 5. Contract Integration
- **Balance Updates**: Automatic contract balance reduction on post
- **Balance Restoration**: Automatic balance restoration on void
- **Real-time Validation**: Show remaining balance preview before posting
- **Active Contract Filtering**: Only show active contracts for new transactions

### 6. Resident Page Integration
- **Balance Widget**: Show active contracts with remaining balances
- **Recent Transactions**: Last 5 transactions with link to full view
- **Quick Actions**: Direct link to create transaction for resident

## Technical Specifications

### Data Model

```typescript
interface Transaction {
  id: string
  residentId: string
  contractId: string
  occurredAt: Date
  serviceCode: string
  description?: string
  quantity: number
  unitPrice: number
  amount: number // quantity * unitPrice (can be overridden)
  status: 'draft' | 'posted' | 'voided'
  note?: string
  createdAt: Date
  createdBy: string
  postedAt?: Date
  postedBy?: string
  voidedAt?: Date
  voidedBy?: string
  voidReason?: string
}

interface TransactionCreateInput {
  residentId: string
  contractId: string
  occurredAt: Date
  serviceCode: string
  description?: string
  quantity: number
  unitPrice: number
  amount?: number // Optional override
  note?: string
}

interface TransactionFilters {
  dateRange?: { from: Date; to: Date }
  residentIds?: string[]
  contractIds?: string[]
  houseIds?: string[]
  statuses?: TransactionStatus[]
  serviceCode?: string
  search?: string
}
```

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/transactions` - List with filtering, sorting, pagination
- `POST /api/transactions` - Create new transaction
- `PUT /api/transactions/[id]` - Update transaction
- `POST /api/transactions/bulk-post` - Bulk post drafts
- `POST /api/transactions/bulk-void` - Bulk void posted
- `DELETE /api/transactions/[id]` - Delete draft transaction
- `GET /api/transactions/export` - CSV export

### Storage Layer

Following existing localStorage pattern:
- `lib/utils/transaction-storage.ts`
- Extends current storage abstraction
- Maintains contract balance consistency
- Atomic operations for balance updates

## User Experience Flow

### Primary Workflow
1. **View Transactions**: Dense table with all filtering options
2. **Create Transaction**: Sheet/dialog with resident→contract selection
3. **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple rows, apply actions
4. **Balance Monitoring**: Real-time balance updates and validation
5. **Export**: CSV download for external processing

### Resident Integration
1. **Balance Widget**: Quick view of contract balances from resident page
2. **Recent Activity**: Last 5 transactions with links
3. **Quick Create**: Direct transaction creation from resident context

## Success Criteria

This PRD provides the foundation for a comprehensive transaction management system that integrates seamlessly with the existing NDIS provider management application while providing the high-performance, dense UX required for operational efficiency.

Enhancement & Bug Updates

1. **Resident Lookup Requirement**: When a user creates a transaction, the "Resident" field must lookup and display all residents available in the system who have:
   - An active status
   - Been assigned to a house
   - Have at least one active service agreement/contract
   - Display format: "FirstName LastName - HouseAddress"
   
2. **Service Code Field**: Changed from dropdown to optional text input with placeholder examples
3. **Unit Price Field**: Increments in $10 increments when using +/- buttons, not $0.01 per click

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
- Resident data should be fetched from API endpoints rather than localStorage for reliability
- Only residents with active contracts should appear in the dropdown
- Loading state should be shown while fetching resident and house data
- Fallback to localStorage if API fails (for development/testing)

### Iteration enhancements to the create Transaction layout

 - when the user has selected the resident ( which is awesome) - and they choose the contract, can you then flash up just under this something like this... This contract starts on XX/XX/XXXXX & ends on XX/XX/XXXXX and is configured for servicing items code XXXXXX
  - the aforementioned information is really about pulling a few variables from the selected agreement, that help guide the user on filling in the transactiuon screen
   - for the selected contract, these variabel are: Contract start date, contract end date & contract support item code
 - Change Date Occurred to Date of Delivery & make this field mandatory
 - Try and fix the alignment on quantity section, the options feel all different sizes
